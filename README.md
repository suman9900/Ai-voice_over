# Ai-voice_over
It is a stremlit app in which we convert the language of any video into english language and merge it with the video.
Here we some python libraries  and os like 
import streamlit as st
import whisper
from gtts import gTTS
from pydub import AudioSegment
import subprocess
import os
import uuid///
this app extract the audio from the video at first .
then write as text and then convert there language.
then it merge the converted text languge into ai voice with the video.
This helps the students for overcoming the language barrier.
